# MLH-LocalHackDay-at-GVP(December 2018)
A quick start for you with Hackathons at GVP


Our project addresses the problem we all have faced in the recent times during our exams. Most people couldnt find books of the corresponding subjects. so we decided to create an interface that provides students access to the PDF of the prescribed textbooks on one go.
To implement this, we have written our own API.
